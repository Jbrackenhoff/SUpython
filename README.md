The suite creates a class that contains all of the header attributes and can be used in a variety of ways. The main functions are:
readsu    - for reading in the amplitudes of the data and the headers
readsuamp - for only reading in the amplitudes of the data
readsuhdr - for only reading in the headers of the data
writesu   - for writing out into SU format
makehdr   - for creating a header object and setting the most important header info
plotsu    - a simple plotting command for the data
